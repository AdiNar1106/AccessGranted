# AccessGranted-master

HackUMass VI Project

12th-14th October, 2018

The Access Granted Project is an application that takes input from a user in the form of a fingerprint attached to a ring and performs a specific task chosen by the user. The user choses an application of their choice on the android app. This app implements the model of a student iClicker remote, a morse code to text converter for people who are disabled, and can be used to make calls to a number with one tap on the fingerprint sensor. Further usages include incrementation and decrementation of a thermostat if it is connected. We used an Arduino Uno to implement the hardware, and Android Studio (Java, XML) to implement the android app. This project was created in a team for the HackUMass VI event.
